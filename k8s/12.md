# ConfigMaps
1. I added volumes and mounted them in deployment.yml
2. Added configMap using .Files.Get
3. Checked that application is running and config.json is present in the pod:
```shell
> kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
moscowtime-6b54d68c67-ad3j2   1/1     Running   0          5m33s
```
```shell
> kubectl exec moscowtime-6b54d68c67-ad3j2 --ls                               
config.json
...
```
```shell
> kubectl exec moscowtime-6b54d68c67-ad3j2 --cat /app/config.json
{
  "data": "Test data"
}
```
